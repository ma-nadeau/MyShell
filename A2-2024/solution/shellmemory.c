// Line memory for program lines; for part 2.
// ---------------------

// We know that program lines will be read, but not modified, until they are
// removed from the line memory. Therefore, we can provide the line directly
// to requests, rather than copying it. Freeing a program will free all of its
// lines.
// When a line is saved, it should be copied. This way, it can be saved from
// a stack-allocated buffer without fear of losing it when the buffer is freed.
struct program_line {
    int allocated; // for sanity-checking
    char *line;
};

struct program_line linememory[MEM_SIZE];

// We have two choices:
//  1. Offer an API that lets the client allocate one line at a time.
//  2. Offer an API that allocates whole programs at a time, and tracks their
//      locations for being freed later.
// (2) sounds harder, and it is, but that work needs to be done _somewhere_.
// The description suggests that rather than doing it here, we can do it in
// the PCB, so we'll do that. This will translate better to having page tables
// in PCBs in part 3 so it's probably the more sensible approach.

// Therefore, our API is to allocate one line at a time. Normally, we'd have
// to worry about fragmentation and contiguity, but, we're supposed to allocate
// everything before anything runs, and everything runs to completion before
// any more commands can execute, AND there's no recursive run/exec.
// All of that combined means we don't have to worry about fragmentation
// at all: between invocations of run/exec, the linememory will be EMPTY!
//
// Actually, there is one case of 'recursive' exec: the tests that look like
//   exec .... #
//   echo shell
//   exec ....
// The 'shell program' will recursively exec. The correct behavior in these
// cases is to enqueue new program(s), not run them to completion immediately.
// We're told we can assume that 1000 lines is enough to hold every program
// that is being tested simultaneously, so we won't worry about the condition
// that the linememory is empty once exec has been called with #.
// At that point, the assumption tells us that there is enough memory left.

size_t next_free_line = 0;
// So we simply record the next free index in a variable.
// We can't reset this whenever a PCB is freed, because we might be running
// with # and the shell might be about to allocate another program and that
// program might not fit in the first hole! So we provide a function to reset
// this, which should be called whenever `exec` is called and we're not in
// 'background mode.'

// [Note: OBS]
// Thinking about memory in terms of "owners" and "borrowers" was
// popularized by Rust, and recently formalized by so-called
// Ownership and Borrowing Systems. They are a concrete way to ensure that our
// programs do not leak memory or access invalid memory, at the cost of
// potentially copying data sometimes that it is not necessary to.
// A small price to pay!
// We highly recommend looking into how this works and using it as
// a mental model when you program.
